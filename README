Warning, this code is horrible and I know that. I've been having trouble focusing lately
and coding was my favorite way to get things done. As you can tell, the code is pieced
together like a puzzle. I've got some crazy stuff I'd like to do with this code, so
hopefully I can get it into the hands of the people to make better. :)


To start things off, we might need a litle organization. How about, a LIST?
Hrm...what kind of list.
Let's make it... like this..

Table of Contents:
 []> Madness
 []> Table of Me lol &slap## ((*cough*)Contents
 []> Some things to do about the project, I dunno...

Okay, well that didn't work. Let's just start by saying.


Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Yeah, that should be obvious to anyone scrolling through the messed up words. So, why not use
14.04 LTS? I dunno, it doesn't work. Try it, create a tissue (tissue? issue? comment?) reply..
So, with Ubuntu 12.04 I used a little bit of MySQL and PHP magic wizard skills and created...
THIS.
I mean, the other pages.
My vision is to add some features, let's see what we can do.
[~_++++]
{}> CronJobs
  {.}> Watchdog (auto-start)
  {.}> Cache Clear (auto-reinstall after N of shares to keep services fast)
{}> fix checker 
{}> actually check the GET/POST inputs instead of just using them. (i know people, calm down. I just needed the main processes coded)


GREAT I just forgot the most important thing...
You need to AUTHENTICATE your 2 servers.
ON the server with THIS script installed login to THIS user's account.
aka
ssh mywebserver.vps.com -l www-data

www-data,root,apache2,I don't know what your username is.
There may be some PHP scripts to check what username it's running under, let me google that for you...

<?php echo exec('whoami'); ?>

BAM just like that
Google fkn foo.
Okay, so you find out what your username is and you ssh into it.
This has to be your VPS, not some webhosting company (unless its cpanel, and if you ask nicely, maybe...)
It should work on a jailed ssh shell (for those of you with cpanel).

su www-data (or w/e your whoami username is for the website)
ssh-keygen


There, now you have generate the keys for your site.
You will now need to do:

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vpsIPthatwillbeaddedlater

You'll have to do that to each vps that you add :)
This allows the safety of your script to have access to your vps only without the need of passwords.
Scarry, huh? ;)

okay i'm tired for now....
I'll write the rest of this another time...
