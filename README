Where is the first place I should look to get help?
	
	IRC, IRC, IRC...
	I can't stress this enough. You will find me (or someone will be able to find me) and get help.
	
	I can't get YOUR help, where else can I look?
	Hopefully someone will be nice enough to start support in other area's, but for now IRC is your best bet.
	
	Okay, IRC...where at?
	
	irc.freenode.net #p2pmine
	
	-or-

There are 5 main steps to getting started:

1) Create SSH key for your webserver, then copy to each server it will be monitoring.
2) Create your database & import the structure_sql.txt
3) Edit .configs.admins.php.dist
4) Rename .configs.admins.php.dist to .configs.admins.php
5) Add your first server!
