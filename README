Where is the first place I should look to get help?
	
	IRC, IRC, IRC...
	I can't stress this enough. You will find me (or someone will be able to find me) and get help.
	
	I can't get YOUR help, where else can I look?
	Hopefully someone will be nice enough to start support in other area's, but for now IRC is your best bet.
	
	Okay, IRC...where at?
	
	irc.freenode.net #p2pmine
	
	-or-

With all the other features currently being added, I don't have a lot of extra time to code in things that arn't directly important to me.
tl;dr I code shortcuts for myself.

I don't mind, however, taking extra time to code functions that are usefull to others. If this is something you'd like to see...request it!


I do need lots of help creating a proper README.


-- for CODE input ---
I am a strange coder.
I code out in large repetative code (currently being slimmed), see what's broken,  clean up the code, build it into portable functions or a proper class structure, then tie api handler into it.
Yeah, that's right...you can manage this bad kitty from any device.
Including that OLD flipphone from 2001 that had the killer MIDI tunes, yeah...it had a web browser. Where else do you think you got your ringtones. ;) Anyways...yeah, that baby will eventually be supported.
I've got LOADS more to offer for this project, INCLUDING...
cronjobs (so you dont actually have to wait for the code to compile...)
^they will also help with page loads....greatly


vvvvvv These features will take a few weeks to support. I've got a lot of other features that have to be added first.
In the WAY WAY future, I'd love to support Amazon Cloud VPS.
I would also love to tie into cloudflare's API to auto-apply coin symbols for subdomains to your domains.
